The example script runs the detrending pipeline:

reads in data
removes outliers
normalizes data
detrends for latitudinal biases
detrends for sampling effort biases

It can be run by sourcing it in an R console

Note that the Supplementary Appendix 2 files are included here for convenience to remove outliers and normalize data.
